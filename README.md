My wife wanted to be able to add groceries to our Grocery wunderlist.

This has our auth token loaded in environment variable, so no real account 
linking yet. If I can figure out the OAuth account linking, this could
have a wider audience.

(|to) (add|put) {almond milk |task } (to | to my| in| on my) {groceries to buy |task_list} (|list)

Additionally, the following were added so we could more easily add things to the Grocery list (which is the default).

AddTask to add {almond milk |task }
AddTask to put {almond milk |task }
AddTask add {almond milk |task }
AddTask put {almond milk |task }
